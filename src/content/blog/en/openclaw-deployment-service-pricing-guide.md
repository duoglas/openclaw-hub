If you're offering OpenClaw deployment as a service, pricing should be simple, outcome-based, and easy for clients to approve.

## Recommended Pricing Structure

### Starter (Setup)
- Best for solo founders and small teams
- Includes: environment setup, Telegram integration, basic command workflow
- Suggested range: **$300–$800** one-time

### Growth (Automation)
- Best for teams that need repeatable business workflows
- Includes: multi-step automation, model fallback strategy, monitoring checklist
- Suggested range: **$900–$2,500** one-time + optional maintenance

### Pro (Ops + Training)
- Best for teams with daily operational load
- Includes: custom workflows, role-based safety rules, team onboarding, 2–4 weeks support
- Suggested range: **$3,000–$8,000** depending on complexity

## How to Protect Margin

- Price by business outcome, not by engineering hours
- Separate "deployment" from "ongoing operations"
- Add paid add-ons: observability, compliance review, response SLA

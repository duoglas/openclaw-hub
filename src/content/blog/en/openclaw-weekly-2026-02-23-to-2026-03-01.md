## This Week in OpenClaw

This week was about two upgrades:

- **Productionizing content ops** with daily/weekly automation.
- **Strengthening technical SEO foundations** across metadata, JSON-LD, and internal links.

In short: we moved from ad-hoc publishing to a repeatable growth system.

## Highlights

### 1) SEO automation workflow
- Added `weekly:roundup` to generate EN/ZH weekly roundup drafts and index daily posts.
- Added `weekly:seo` to generate weekly SEO reports from repo activity.
- Added `daily:seo` to generate daily SEO snapshots with manual GSC slots + automatic content stats.

### 2) Technical SEO improvements
- Added `Article` + `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD on blog posts.
- Added sitewide `WebSite` JSON-LD.
- Added `ItemList` JSON-LD on blog index pages.
- Improved social metadata:
  - default `og:type=website`
  - blog `og:type=article`
  - default `og:image` / `twitter:image` with blog `heroImage` fallback.

### 3) Internal linking and topic authority
- Added a pillar-link module on EN/ZH daily posts.
- Added a sitewide `Core Guides` block on blog posts (self-link auto-excluded).
- Strengthened strategic links in the EN VPS deployment pillar page.

### 4) Domain/canonical consistency cleanup
- Fixed root canonical/hreflang references to use `https://kuoo.uk`.
- Updated static `robots.txt` and sitemap references away from old-domain leftovers.

1. Integrate GSC exports to auto-fill KPI and top queries in daily/weekly reports.
2. Backfill historical `(this commit)` placeholders in growth queue with real hashes.
3. Publish issue-led tutorials: plugin breakage after updates, 429 fallback patterns, persistent memory workflows.

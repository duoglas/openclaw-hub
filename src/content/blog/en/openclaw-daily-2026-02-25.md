## Top 3 Priorities Today
- v2026.2.23 expands provider/search flexibility and improves session/cron maintenance workflows.
- Review SSRF config migration: allowPrivateNetwork -> dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork.
- Use explicit profile routing + relay attach visibility for browser automation stability.

## Do These Now
- `openclaw doctor --fix`
- `openclaw sessions cleanup --dry-run`
- `openclaw browser status`

## Watch Next
- Kimi search stability/cost in your current workflow
- Disk/session metrics after cleanup enforcement

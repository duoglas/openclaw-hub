## Focus: Convert repeated problems into durable assets

### 1) Productize repeated issues
Recurring topics (gateway failures, relay problems, Telegram setup, deployment errors) should become searchable FAQ/tutorials.

### 2) Review docs on schedule
Tutorial quality decays fast. Weekly review should verify:
- Commands still run
- Links still work
- Steps still match current OpenClaw behavior

### 3) Maintain a topic backlog
Track trend inputs from docs, GitHub, community discussions, and search demand, then classify topics into:
- Beginner setup
- Troubleshooting
- Advanced optimization

## Daily takeaway
- **The real moat is a continuously updated knowledge base, not one viral post.**
- For steady growth, combine FAQ + comparison + deployment guides.
- Tomorrow’s watchpoints: search intent changes, article depth, issue recurrence.

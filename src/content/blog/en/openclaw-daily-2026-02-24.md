## Top 3 Priorities Today
- Focus on the highest-impact operational checks first (channel, gateway, and session hygiene).
- Prefer deterministic troubleshooting order over ad-hoc trial-and-error.
- Keep changes auditable: fix, verify, then record migration/cleanup outcomes.

## Do These Now
- `openclaw doctor --fix`
- `openclaw status`
- `openclaw gateway probe`

## Watch Next
- Service reliability trend over time
- Storage and session growth after cleanup policy changes

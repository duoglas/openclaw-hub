### EXP-002
- Hypothesis: Enforcing WEEKLY_REVIEW freshness in CI will prevent weekly review drift and keep the review cadence stable.
- Scope: Repo-level CI + weekly review scaffold
- Change: Added `scripts/check-weekly-review-cadence.sh`, npm script `check:weekly-review`, and CI step to fail when current-week line is missing in `WEEKLY_REVIEW.md`.
- Start date: 2026-02-26
- End date: 2026-02-26
- Success metric: CI catches stale WEEKLY_REVIEW before merge; current week check passes after `pnpm weekly:seo`.
- Result: pass (local check verified on current week).
- Decision: scale
